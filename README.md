# Spotify-Tidy-Library

This is a self explanatory project. It is for cleaning up a users soptify librabry. I made this out of nessesity as I had a lot of songs in my main spotify playlist that I didn't liek anymore.

Current features:
- Auto remove songs from a playlist that are not in the user's 'liked songs' or saved songs.

At the moment, you need to link the script to your own spotify developer account. Constants should be edited in the main.py file.
